# ftpSetup

I just wanted a place to be able to grab these files so I could quickly setup a LAN ftpserver for various reasons.

This was hastily thrown together in python, a language I have never used before, so it could for sure be better; however, I just wanted to get an ftpserver working quickly and security isn't an issue in my case so use at your own risk.

This was made for Ubuntu Server 18.04

             : make sure to make the check.sh executable, and run the python script with root permissions
